# Legacy Blynk Server Binaries

This repository is my personal collection of all legacy server binaries released by [Blynk](https://www.blynk.io) on `https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server` which have now been deleted around September 2022

## Note that this Blynk Legacy server is now discontinued and unsupported!

It does not work with the latest Blynk app, and the Legacy app withdrawn from the app/play stores from 30th June 2022.

Using a local legacy server should be seen as an interim measure, because the server will eventually become vulnerable when support for Java 11 is withdrawn and when the apps no longer run on newer mobile OS releases.

## No warranty use at your own risk

Versions prior to 0.41.17 are certainly affected by security problems of the Log4j2 library ([see here](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html))

## Latest binary

Latest binary is version [0.41.17](https://github.com/gablau/blynk-server-binaries/tree/master/0.41.17)

## Server source code

A fork of the source code can be found here: [https://github.com/gablau/blynk-server](https://github.com/gablau/blynk-server)
